# lab_two
data types
For Lab 2, you will write a program that accepts numeric and string inputs from a user, assigns them to variables, performs some calculations with them, and then prints out the output.

As long as your program satisfies the requirements listed below, you are free to design and write any program that you want to. You are encouraged to be creative and pick something that has meaning for you because you'll have more fun. You are welcome to start with one of the programming exercises from Chapters 2, 9, 10, or 11 from the textbook. Your program may not be an exact copy of any exercise or example. 

After completing this assignment, you will be able to:
Collaborate on a program using the online IDE Replit
Write a Python program that accepts input, does a calculation, and produces output
Follow the Style Guidelines for writing Python programs in this course
Use system functions to format string and numeric output
Chain functions by using the output of one function as the input to another function

Using Replit, create a Python program and share an invite link with your partner. Your program must include the following requirements:
Accept a numeric value and a string value (at a minimum, may be more) as input from the user using input().
Perform at least one calculation using arithmetic operators and use at least one compound operator (+=, -=, *=).
Use at least one date-time function (date(), time(), datetime()).
Use round() and format the numeric values in the output.
Use format() on a string and print in the output.
Include at least one chaining function.
Include at least one output that has a concatenated string (print() using "+" ).
